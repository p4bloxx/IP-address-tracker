## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- SCSS syntax
- SASS variables
- Javascript
- Leaflet - API for interactive map [https://leafletjs.com/]
- Ipify - API for Ip address info [https://geo.ipify.org/]

### What I learned

Hello everyone ;) in this challenge I practiced again with the use of **2 different APIs**, one to request information regarding the IP address provided by the user and the other to connect the coordinates of this address to an interactive map that reached the associated geographic address.

I had some small problems regarding the management of the data relating to the input field **(data entered by the user)** as I had to manage both a possible IP address and a domain name of a website, but after some tests I was able to I succeeded and I'm quite satisfied with the result ;)

### Continued development

I want to try to create other challenges with the help of **APIs** as up to now I have had little practice, so in the near future I will continue along this line ;)
